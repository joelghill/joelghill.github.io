It's been a while since my last update and I thought I should check in and report one of my latest success stories with the Apple Pi! 

[A while back I accidentally fried my display.](/_posts\2019-08-04-display-failure.md) It was a sad day, but I forged on and bought a replacement off eBay. I also purchased the [**correct** controller board.](https://www.ebay.com/itm/NT68676-HDMI-DVI-VGA-LCD-Controller-Board-for-1680X1050-Panel-LTN154MT07-G01/123585092400?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649) for the MacBook LCD.

Well, both components have since arrived in the mail and I am very happy to report that the display works and I can now output video from the Raspberry Pi to the MacBook Pro screen!

I also took the time to reassemble the display with the new converter attached. Everything is functional, however if I were to go through this process again I would avoid the disassembly altogether. Removing the thin aluminum face plate from the front of the screen was difficult, and I accidentally introduced several bends an imperfections to its shape. The process also weakened the adhesive, and so there are a few areas where the face now pulls away from the screen.

I made an attempt to compress the front plate into the remaining adhesive, but it only kind of worked:

Rather than removing the screen and plugging the controller directly into the display port, I would recommend finding a male to male connector to attached the existing display cable to the converter cable. You would avoid tearing apart the display and it would give you more freedom when placing the controller inside the laptop body.

In the end its hard to be disappointed with the results though!
